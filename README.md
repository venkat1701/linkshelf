# Linkshelf

A collaborative knowledge repository where team members share valuable articles they've read with concise summaries. This helps everyone stay informed and provides quick access to essential information without reading entire articles.

## Purpose

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Centralize interesting and useful resources in one place
- **Time Saving**: Quick access to article summaries instead of reading full articles
- **Collective Learning**: Learn from others' reading discoveries
- **Easy Reference**: Structured format for finding relevant information later
